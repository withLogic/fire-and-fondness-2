If only true love were so simply proven...\n\nI hope you've enjoyed these little puzzles of mine. All that is left to say are a few notes of thanks: to all those who have lent a guiding hand in making this game what it is, to those who have driven me with their excitement, and, of course, to you.\n\nThank you for playing.\nSee you next time..."
